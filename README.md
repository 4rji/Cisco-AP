# Cisco Class Project: Flashing an Access Point

![Header Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4d18f06-7139-49cc-99a4-d7f9fcde3c49)

*This project was created as part of a Cisco networking class.*

## üéØ Objective

Flash and configure a Cisco Access Point (AP) as an extra hands-on activity beyond the standard class exercises.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Background

In a previous session, two routers were configured with three networks to connect two computers from different subnets. This project takes it a step further by flashing a Cisco AP.

## üîß Equipment

- **Cisco Aironet Access Point** (Model: `AIR-CAP3702I-A-K9`)
- **macOS** for serial access
- **Kali Linux** for TFTP server

## ‚ùãÔ∏è Steps

### 1. Console Access

Connect the AP to your computer using a USB console cable. On macOS, access it via:

```bash
screen /dev/tty.usbmodemXXXX 9600
```

### 2. Set Static IP


```bash
ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0
ip link set eth0 up
```

### 3. TFTP Server Setup on Kali Linux

Install the TFTP server:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tftpd-hpa
```

Edit the configuration file `/etc/default/tftpd-hpa`:

```bash
TFTP_USERNAME="tftp"
TFTP_DIRECTORY="/var/lib/tftpboot"
TFTP_ADDRESS="0.0.0.0:69"
TFTP_OPTIONS="--secure"
```

Create the directory, move the image, and set permissions:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/tftpboot
sudo cp ap_image.tar /var/lib/tftpboot/
sudo chmod -R 777 /var/lib/tftpboot
```

Restart the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart tftpd-hpa
```

### 4. Troubleshooting with tcpdump

Check if the AP is trying to reach the TFTP server:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port 69
```

If no traffic is visible, verify:
- Network cables
- Static IP settings
- Subnet matching
- Correct TFTP path and filename

### 5. Flashing the AP

![TFTP Server Setup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e80faae3-7f7e-4277-b330-7fdc1b43fc12)


From the AP‚Äôs console, execute the following commands:

```bash
set IP_ADDR 192.168.1.101
set NETMASK 255.255.255.0
set DEFAULT_ROUTER 192.168.1.1
set TFTP_SERVER 192.168.1.100
tar -xtract tftp://192.168.1.100/ap_image.tar flash:
boot
```

## ‚úÖ Installed at home on a POE switch, directly connected to the AP.

## ‚úÖ Panel

![AP Functional](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44d58810-905a-44ed-a583-9edeeb364c40)

The AP is now functional and accessible with default credentials:
- **Username:** Cisco
- **Password:** Cisco
